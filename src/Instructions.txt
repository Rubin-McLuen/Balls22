Instructions:
    You're given a set number of balls, which is shown next to the starting dot.
    You have to shoot the balls at the blocks, and try to break all of them with
    your balls.
    If you can break all of the blocks with the balls, you win.
    If any of the blocks are left standing after all of your balls disappear, you lose.
